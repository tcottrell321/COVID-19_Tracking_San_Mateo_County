Tracks COVID-19 Statistics for San Mateo CA using Excel and county level data

### Description
Using data posted on the San Mateo County COVID-19 website, I transcribe data from their dashboard to an excel spreadsheet. The amount of data is small enough that it only takes a few minutes to update the spreadsheet once/week. I then created a simple stacked bar chart using built-in Excel graphing functions to visualize the data stratified in bins by age. And finally, I add in the hospital utilization rates in an in-graph table. 

The excel spreadsheet has been uploaded to the repository and a capture image of the graph saved to the image file shown below.
